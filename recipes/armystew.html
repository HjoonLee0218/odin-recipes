    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Army stew, also known as "budae jjigae," is a unique and flavorful Korean dish that encapsulates a fusion of history and taste. Originating after the Korean War, the dish creatively combines American military surplus ingredients like Spam, sausages, and canned beans with traditional Korean flavors. This hearty stew features a spicy and savory broth, laden with an array of ingredients such as sliced meats, tofu, instant noodles, vegetables, and sometimes even cheese. Its communal nature, where diners gather around a bubbling pot on the table, adds to the conviviality of the experience. Army stew not only symbolizes resourcefulness during challenging times but also offers a delightful medley of flavors that resonate with both nostalgia and modern appetites.</p>
